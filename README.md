# Vanilla Components

Component based ui library, similar to widgets in flutter

## Why?

I don't like current state of the web development, that is HTML + CSS + JS or even with frameworks JSX. I don't like it.

I found Flutter's approach to be much better, this is kinda how ui framework should be.

Ofcourse backwards compatability or any other excuses, make us to forcefully use unfun and weird languages

That's why I'm going to make a Component Based Ui Framework, so I don't have to touch html or css again.

(Don't depend on this, I'll probably forget I'm working on this soon)

I'm kinda doing it for myself, so I don't expect anyone else to use

I don't care about SEO or anything, this framework is just made to make development easier and while being as lightweight as possible

Hopefully, everyone agrees to move on from html and css soon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
